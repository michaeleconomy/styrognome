This virtual table top is designed for asynchronous play - so you don't have to find a time that works for all of your players. Players get a push notification when things happen and to let you know when it's their turn to play. The app implements the open source fifth edition (5e) rule set so that you don't have to spend as much time reading source books, and instead focus on adventuring. The game incorporates low-poly 3d graphics to visualize the virtual world."
